# QA Smoke Checklist

- App launches without error (no visible main window)
- Tray icon appears (or in overflow ^) and shows a balloon tip
- Toggle Enable/Disable from tray: cursor control turns on/off
- Left stick moves cursor smoothly at default sensitivity
- Open Settings…, adjust **Sensitivity** and **Deadzone**, close → settings persist
- Hold-to-drag: press/hold A (when added), drag a window for 30s without drop
- Scroll (when added): works in Edge, Notepad, Explorer
- Disconnect/reconnect controller: app stays stable
